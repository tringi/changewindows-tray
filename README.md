# ChangeWindows.org Notification

**Unofficial** Tray Notification Application for https://changewindows.org project.  
Designed for smallest possible footprint. By [TRIM CORE SOFTWARE](https://www.trimcore.cz) s.r.o.

## Installation

Download appropriate executable from the [builds directory](builds),
copy it into your *Program Files*, and make a link in Startup to have it started automatically.

After the initial sync, a Settings dialog will be available to configure reporting.

## Settings

Use text inputs/dropdowns and + button to add combinations of releases that you wish to be notified about.  
Trash button deletes selected ones. Double-click existing entry to switch to edit mode.

Use DOS filename wildcards, i.e. `22???` for build will notify about builds 22000 to 22999, `*` means everything.
Leaving *Channel/Release* empty will report on new builds, not updates to existing, although this distinction
is mostly irrelevant.

Options:

* **Check every # minutes** - keep as large as reasonable to not DDoS the website
* **Animate notification icon** - currently cannot be disabled (off option not implemented)
* **Check for legacy platforms** - do not ignore platforms marked as *legacy*, e.g.: Mobile, IoT and 10X
* **Group toast by build numbers** - use *Build* notification format if possible (see below)

## Command-line parameters

When you run `ChangeWindows.exe param` the following happens depending on `param`:

* `hide` – starts the program without tray icon, or hides the existing one
* `show` – restores hidden tray icon of the running program (if any is running)
* `check` – instructs the running program to check for any updates
* `settings` – instructs the running instance to open Settings dialog
* `terminate` – closes the running instance

## Manual configuration

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\TRIM CORE SOFTWARE s.r.o.\ChangeWindows\alerts`
* values' (type is irelevant) name is filename wildcards -style mask for the builds; those will be reported by alert

**Example**
* `*` - report everything
* `PC;*` - report all PC updates
* `PC;Canary` - report new builds in Canary channel for PC
* `PC;*#22???` - report all build 22000 to 22999 updates for PCs in any channel
* `*#17763` - report everything regarding build 17763 regardless platform or channel

## Toast notifications

Text length in Toast (Balloon on Windows 8.1 and earlier) notifications is quite limited
which makes it difficult to fit in all the possible changes, e.g. on Second Tuesday updates.
The applications attempts to combine the news in various ways,
but the notification may look different each time.
